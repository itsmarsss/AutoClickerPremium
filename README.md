**What is Auto Clicker "Premium"?** -
 Auto Clicker "Premium" is a "Premium" auto clicker that you can use to destroy people in Minecraft PvP (1.8.x). It's job is to click `x` amount of times for a second after you tell it to by left clicking.

**Why would you want Auto Clicker "Premium"?** -
You *want* Auto Clicker "Premium" because I know you are bad at Minecraft PvP, it will help you destroy enemies assuming you are with with movement and gamesense (make sure you **dont** get banned). This auto clicker can also be used on other games that require clicking, like Cookie Clicker.

**How to download?**
Head over to [[Releases]](https://github.com/itsmarsss/AutoClickerPremium/releases) and download the latest version! 

If you are on a Windows machine, download `AutoClickerPremiumInstaller.zip`, this will install Auto Clicker "Premium" as an app on your computer! 

If you are not on a Windows machine, you will need to install the latest version of Java from a [safe source](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) ***(If you have Minecraft installed then you wont need to download Java again\*)***
